# Obino-portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Emmanuel Amatasoro while family and friends call me Obi or Obino. i am curious about data, numbers, binaries and "what could be". This has always been my approach ever since i heard a lyric from my favorite musician Rick Ross "Life is all about what you make it". it was very catchy and very true. i have always been conscious about what is True and what is a lie giving the fact that "when you want to hurt a strong man, you tell him a lie and when you want to hurt a weak man, you tell him the truth". That being said, i began to work and carve my own future brick by brick and never to repeat the same mistake but to learn from it. that is where my love for research came to existence and reality. Data and Big data is simply my truck in my farm, making my hervest time and output more efficient and effective. i have a Bsc in economics and i was able to do multiple research on case studies like "correlation between the growth of small and medium term enterprises with GDP" and also "Rural to Urban migration effects on employment rate, inflation and security" and a couple more. If you can think it, i can make it. Thank you for reading and welcome!
